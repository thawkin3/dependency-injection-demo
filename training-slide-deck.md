# Dependency Injection

## What is dependency injection?

Pattern where instead of hard-coding dependencies inside a function/class/module, you pass the dependencies in as arguments.

Also know as "inversion of control" or "dependency inversion."

Dependency injection lets you work with interfaces rather than implementation details






























## Why do this?

1. Decoupling (now you can pass whatever you want)

2. Flexibility (now you can pass whatever you want)

3. Testability (now you can pass whatever you want)




























## Let's look at an example

Parse a cookie string in JavaScript












## Closing thoughts

In the React-world, dependency injection is something we take for granted

If you find that it's hard to get something under test, consider trying dependency injection
